# Resume
This is a github dump of all of the projects that did not seem as important as other entries on my paper resume. Here there will be various documentation, descriptions, and code. Documentation and code will be provided for projects included on the paper resume as well. Descriptions will not be included for those as summaries already exist on the paper resume.

As this github account was in use to submit some assignments prior to this idea (and will likely be more in the future), there are a couple of projects floating outside of this repository that I'd rather not repeat in here. I have grouped all of these projects under this tag: https://github.com/stars/Zach-Bravo/lists/old-project-not-grouped
