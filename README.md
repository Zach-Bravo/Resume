# Resume
This is a github dump of all of the projects that did not seem as important as other entries on my paper resume. Here there will be various documentation, descriptions, and code.

As this github account was in use to submit some assignments prior to this idea (and will likely be more in the future), there are a couple of projects floating outside of this repository that I'd rather not repeat in here. I have grouped all of these projects under this tag: https://github.com/stars/Zach-Bravo/lists/old-project-not-grouped
